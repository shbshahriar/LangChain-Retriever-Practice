# LangChain-Retriever-Practice
A practice project using LangChain's retriever system with Wikipedia, ChromaDB, FAISS, and MMR. It demonstrates semantic search, multi-query retrieval, and contextual compression techniques for enhanced document retrieval. Great for learning how to build advanced search and retrieval pipelines.
